Getting Startet
*****************

To use ROSVITA, no complex installation process is necessary, because the ROSVITA Docker image already contains all the necessary packages and dependencies. All you need is:

* An up-to-date `Ubuntu <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/>`_ operating system (16.04 or higher),
* The software container platform `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce>`_ (:ref:`short installation instructions <docker-installation-label>`),
* And finally the **ROSVITA Docker image**.

.. note:: For safety reasons, it is recommended to use **two network cards**: one for your intranet and one for your robot. For setting up the two network connections, click on the symbol with the two arrows in the top bar of your Ubuntu installation and select the menu item "Edit Connections...". For your intranet choose a dynamic IP address (IPv4 Settings -> Method: Automatic (DHCP)) and for your robot choose a static IP address (IPv4 Settings -> Method: Manual).

To be able to pull the ROSVITA Docker image from `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_, you need a Docker account. If you do not have a Docker ID already, simply `sign up to Docker <https://cloud.docker.com/>`_ with username, Email address and password. If you are interested in getting early access to a BETA version of ROSVITA, please `contact us <http://xamla.com/en/#early-access>`_ so we can give you permission to pull the ROSVITA Docker image from Docker Hub. Moreover, we intend to make publicly available a first official version of ROSVITA in mid-2018. From then on, everyone with valid Docker account should be able to ``docker pull`` the ROSVITA image from Docker Hub without restrictions.

Use the following commands to pull the latest ROSVITA Docker image from Docker Hub. 
**Change the version tag v0.2 to the current version number!**

.. code-block:: bash

   docker login
   docker pull xamla/early-access-rosvita:v0.2

Thereafter, ROSVITA can be started by following the steps:

1. Go into your home folder and download the shell script `rosvita-start.sh <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xamla/docs.xamla.com/gh-pages/rosvita/Downloads/rosvita_start.sh>`_.
2. Change permissions to be able to execute the start script.
3. And finally execute the script.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xamla/docs.xamla.com/gh-pages/rosvita/Downloads/rosvita_start.sh
   chmod u+x rosvita-start.sh
   ./rosvita-start.sh

.. note:: **Change the version tag v0.2** of the ROSVITA Docker image used in this script **to the actual version number:** ``xamla/early-access-rosvita:v0.2 -> xamla/early-access-rosvita:vX.X``.


In an internet browser (for example in **Chrome**), the user interface of the "Rosvita Robot Programming System" can now be opened by entering ``localhost:5000`` in the address bar. The login screen appears. After successful login with username and password (default: **admin** and **r2d2c3po**), the ROSVITA main development environment opens (see :ref:`next chapter <main-view-label>`).

To stop ROSVITA simply type:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker stop rosvita

.. note:: All changes to files of the ROSVITA Docker image are temporary and get lost after an update of the image. Therefore, **do not modify the ROSVITA Docker image, but always make changes locally in your own project folder** (~/Rosvita/projects/).
